    "## Introduction\n",
    "The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that about 20 to 50 million people suffer from non-fatal injuries from vehicle accidents globally every year. Some of the risk factors the WHO considers in their report are speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol or other psychoactive substances, improper use of road safety equipment (helmet, seat belts etc.), distracting the driver, unsafe road infrastructure and so on. Also, the Center for Disease Control shows that every year in the United States, about 3 million people are involved in accidents that cause serious injury. In 2017, the cost to the US economy was huge at about $75billion in medical care cost and lost productivity from vehicle accidents alone. The Seattle Department of Transportationâ€™s annual traffic report shows that there were 10,959 vehicle-related accidents reported by the police in 2017. The effect of car accidents on the society and economy should be of interest to stakeholders and the government. "
